Does your keyboard not have dedicated media keys? I know mine doesn't. 
You can copy the scripts in this repository to AutoHotkey, and create shortcuts for media keys.

Here is the current setup for the autohotkey script:

* Ctrl + Alt + Space = Pause
* Ctrl + Alt + Right Arrow Key = Go go next
* Ctrl + Alt + Left Arrow Key: Go to previous
* Ctrl + Alt + Up Arrow Key : Decrease Volume
* Ctrl + Alt + Down Arrow Key : Increase Volume
* Ctrl + Alt + 0 (on the number line) : Mute Volume


Note: If you would like the 0 to be on the numberline, copy the script titled "Number_Line_Script.ahk".

If you wouud like the 0 to be on the numberpad, copy the script titled "Number_Pad_Script.ahk"



To Convert i, j, k and l to arrow keys on your computer, you can press alt. 
The following is what the "arrow_keys.ahk" script does:

* Alt + k = down
* Alt + i = Up arrow
* Alt + l = Right Arrow
* Alt + j = Left Arrow
